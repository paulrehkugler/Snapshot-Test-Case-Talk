Rapid View Prototyping Using FBSnapshotTestCase

——

Define terms:
	- What is rapid view prototyping?
	- What is FBSnapshotTestCase?

Quick overview of FBSnapshotTestCase so that this talk is useful to people who are unfamiliar

How to write tests for rapid view prototyping:
	- DeviceOrientation class
	- UIViewController helper extension
	- example test

Demo

But my ViewController isn’t testable like that one!
	- dependency injection for data
	- maybe your view controller is too complex and you should just break your view controller’s layout code into a custom UIView

Why is this better than IB assistant pane?
	- at the end of writing this, you have working unit tests
	- works with and without IB, so you can appease people that like to write layout in code
